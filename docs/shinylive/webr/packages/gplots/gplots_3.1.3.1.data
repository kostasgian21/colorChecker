2015-04-23  warnes

	* [r1955] Update NEWS and ChangeLog
	* [r1954] In heatmap.2(), the color key now properly handles color
	  breaks that
	  are not equally spaced. (Issue reported by Tim Richter-Heitmann.)
	* [r1948] - plotCI() was not properly respecting the 'type='
	  argument. This has
	  been corrected.
	* [r1947] - Remove stray browser() call from overplot()
	* [r1943] Explicitly specify argument to gplots:::reorder.factor to
	  prevent error.
	* [r1942] - The returned object from venn() now includes a
	  'interesection'
	  attribution containing a list of which items are in each set
	  intersection. This can be turned off by settting
	  'intersection=FALSE'.
	* [r1941] Patch submitted by Ilia Kats:
	  - easily extract and plot subclusters from a big heatmap using
	  the
	  same colorkey, by passing a dendgrogram of the subcluster
	  together
	  with the full data matrix and, optionally, the breaks of the full
	  heatmap in order to obtain the same color scaling. This is useful
	  if
	  one wants to plot several subclusters as different panels in a
	  paper, but maintain consistent color coding.
	  - Improves the behavior of the color key axis labels, as they now
	  honor par("cex") and par("cex.lab").
	* [r1940] In heatmap.2() split calls to distfun() and hclustfun()
	  into separate steps to make debugging easier

	  logic more evident by replacing min() with any(). (The previous
	  code executed properly, but relied on implicit coercion of
	  logicals
	  to numeric, obscuring the intent.)

2002-11-04  warnes

	* [r143] Updates from Marc Schwartz:
	  
	  - Updated underlying code to be based upon the new barplot() in R
	  v1.6.1
	  - This now uses the 'axis.lty' and 'border' arguments
	  - In R v1.6.0, R Core introduced a new function called axTicks().
	  This is an R equivalent of the C code for CreateAtVector in
	  plot.c.
	  This now enables me to get the axis tick mark positions
	  consistently
	  when the 'height' related axis is either linear or log. Thus, I
	  can
	  now have consistent tick marks and can plot grid lines in either
	  situation. If 'plot.grid = TRUE' and 'grid.inc' is specified,
	  then
	  I still use pretty() to determine the tick marks and lines.
	  - This code now depends on R 1.6.0 or later.

2002-10-30  warnes

	* [r139] - Commented out plot.lm() code since recent changes in R
	  have broken it.

	* [r131] - Fixed log scale errors in legend() call

2002-10-01  warnes

	* [r130] - Added examples of using 'contour' and 'filled.contour'
	  for display.

2002-09-24  warnes

	* [r121] - Changed digits=options("digits") which produces a list
	  of length 1
	  to digits=getOption("digits") which returns a vector of length
	  one.
	  The former was causing an error when passed to round().

2002-09-23  warnes

	* [r119] - Fixed syntax errors in barplot2.Rd and CrossTable.Rd
	  - Fixed incorrect translation of 'F' (distribution) to 'FALSE' in
	  glh.test.Rd
	* [r117] - Modified all files to include CVS Id and Log tags.
	* [r116] - Added CrossTable() and barplot2() code and docs
	  contributed by Marc Schwartz.
	  - Permit combinations() to be used when r>n provided
	  repeat.allowed=TRUE
	  - Bumped up version number

2002-08-01  warnes

	* [r114] - Corrected documentation mismatch for ci, ci.default.
	  
	  - Replaced all occurences of '_' for assignment with '<-'.
	  
	  - Replaced all occurences of 'T' or 'F' for 'TRUE' and 'FALSE'
	  with
	  the spelled out version.

	  lowess.default.
	  
	  - Fixed a wrong default for f in lowess.formula. Was 3, but
	  should
	  have been 2/3.

2002-03-26  warneg

	* [r104] - Changed methods to include '...' to match the generic.
	  - Updated for version 0.5.1
	* [r100] Initial checkin.

2002-03-20  warneg

	* [r94] - Changes to add compatibility with S-Plus 2000
	* [r93] - Changes to add compatibility with S-Plus 2000.
	* [r92] - Updated to work in S-Plus 2000 as well as R.

2002-03-05  warneg

	  variable named "T".

2002-02-20  warneg

	* [r81] Minor changes, typo and formatting fixes.
	* [r80] - Generalized to allow specification of the multiples of

2002-02-16  warneg

	* [r78] Added bandplot documentation.
	* [r77] - Fixed Bug: When method=="range", the absolute range of x
	  was being
	  used to compute the relative width instead of the (correct)
	  relative
	  range.
	* [r76] - Corrected problem removing missing values: The missing
	  values of $x
	  and $y were being removed indepdendently, leaving an uneven
	  number
	  of points in the result.

2002-02-04  warneg

	* [r74] - Add na.rm parameter and make the default TRUE.
	* [r73] Initial checkin.
	* [r72] - When err="x", 'col' was being used to plot bars, rather
	  than 'barcol'.

	  error.

2001-12-12  warneg

	* [r54] - Quoted underscore character in my email address.
	  - Added correct keyword.

	  parens
	  rather than curly brackets.
	* [r42] Initial checkin.
	* [r41] - Added cvs tags.
	* [r40] - Leave first point at center, rather than shifting by s/2
	  to the left. This looks better when there are more than 2
	  'spaced' points.

2001-12-05  warneg

	* [r33] - Added ability to use the t-distribution to compute
	  confidence
	  intervals. This is controlled using the 'use.t' parameter.
	* [r31] - Added documentation of use.t parameter.
	* [r30] - Clarified how the width of the window is computed when
	  method="nobs".
	* [r29] - Added a better default for "width" when method="nobs".
	  For this case,
	  width=max(5, length(x)/10).
	  
	  - Allow omission of x values which result in missing y values via
	  'drop.na' parameter.

2001-10-26  warneg

    ('bandplot', 'wapply'),
  - enhanced versions of standard plots ('barplot2', 'boxplot2',
    'heatmap.2', 'smartlegend'),
  - manipulating colors ('col2hex', 'colorpanel', 'redgreen',
    'greenred', 'bluered', 'redblue', 'rich.colors'),
  - calculating and plotting two-dimensional data summaries ('ci2d',
    'hist2d'),
  - enhanced regression diagnostic plots ('lmplot2', 'residplot'),
  - formula-enabled interface to 'stats::lowess' function ('lowess'),
  - displaying textual data in plots ('textplot', 'sinkplot'),
  - plotting a matrix where each cell contains a dot whose size
    reflects the relative magnitude of the elements ('balloonplot'),
  - plotting "Venn" diagrams ('venn'),
  - displaying Open-Office style plots ('ooplot'),
  - plotting multiple data on same region, with separate axes
    ('overplot'),
  - plotting means and confidence intervals ('plotCI', 'plotmeans'),
  - spacing points in an x-y plot so they don't overlap ('space').

Release 3.1.3 - 2022-04-24
--------------------------
Bug Fixes:
- Fix warning:

checking Rd files ... [1s/2s] WARNING
checkRd: (7) barplot2.Rd:219: invalid email address: marc\_schwartz@comcast.net
checkRd: (7) venn.Rd:59: invalid email address: steffen\_moeller@gmx.de

- Fix note:

checking Rd cross-references ... NOTE
Undeclared package r2d2 in Rd xrefs

- Fix note:

Found if() conditions comparing class() to string:
File 'gplots/R/heatmap.2.R': if (class(col) == "function") ...
Use inherits() (or maybe is()) instead.

Release 3.1.2 - 2021-01-09
--------------------------
Bug Fixes:
- heatmap.2: Also use key.title in cases without density #4




Release 3.1.1 - 2020-11-28
--------------------------
Bug Fixes:
- Fix "Error in plot.window(...) : need finite 'ylim' values" in "Running examples in 'gplots-Ex.R' failed"




Release 3.1.0 - 2020-09-18
--------------------------
Major change:
- Removed gdata from imports by bringing into the package the functions nobs and reorder.factor.
  - Removed the gdata package from "imports" since it is currently broken and is scheduled to archive in 2020-09-25 (leading to gplots to be archived as well, unless this is resolved). By removing this connection, gplots will be able to remain safely on CRAN. In prectice, I've moved reorder.factor and nobs into this package, as well as removed the use of 'nobs' from some examples.
  - Added the reorder.factor and nobs function (from gdata)


Release 3.0.4 - 2020-07-05
--------------------------
Bug Fixes:
- Fix "no visible global function definition for '%||%'": The package imports .memberDend and .midDend from stats in an unsafe way (i.e. using :::). I've moved to manually copy-pasting the functions into the package in order to keep it a bit safer. It has the downside of not using whartever improvements/bugfixes are intrudced to these functions moving forward. But for the time being, it's a reasonable solution.

Release 3.0.3 - 2020-02-26
--------------------------

Misc
- Tal Galili took over to make sure the package stays on CRAN.
- Moved to knitr

Release 3.0.1 - 2016-03-30
--------------------------

Bug Fixes:

- An error in plotLowess() prevented it from finding objects in
	the caller's environment.

- The manual page for heatmap.2() stated the incorrect type for
  the 'layout' element of the return list.  It is a named list,
  not a named numeric vector.


Release 3.0.0 - 2016-03-28
---------------------------

New Features:

- venn():
    - now support matrices of indicator values. Previously indicator
      values were only supported when supplied as a dataframe.
    - The 'intersections' attribute returned from venn() has been
      improved so that goups are labeled using set names instead
      of indicators, and are ordered from simplest to most complex
      set intersection.

- New angleAxis() function to create axis labels with rotated text.

- heatmap.2():
    - heatmap.2() can now be used to plot subsets of a previous
      heatmap.
    - Decrease the granularity of the carpet in heatmap.2()'s
      color key to avoid visual artifacts.
    - Returned object now includes 'layout' element that contains
      layout information. (Patch provided by Jenny Drnevich.)

- lowess():
    - New function plotLowess() to display a scatter plot with a
      superimposed lowess curve.
    - The lowess() functions now returns a list object of class
      'lowess'
    - A new lowess method for plot() method for 'lowess' objects
      that generates a scatterplot of the raw data with a lowess
      curve superimposed.

Bug Fixes:

- Defunct message for boxplot.n() was recommending the wrong
  function.

- heatmap.2():
  - Remove debugging print() statement.
  - Now properly sets 'srtCol' default if missing and 'colCol' is
    specified.
  - Corrected a bug causing "Error in plot.new() : figure margins
    too large" to occur when 'key=FALSE'.  (Reported and patch
    provided by Sveinung Gundersen.)
  - Corrected a bug causing an error when "Rowv=FALSE" or "Colv=FALSE".
  - Corrected message when "Rowv=FALSE" or "Colv=FALSE" and the the
    "dendrogram" argument requested the corresponding dendrogram.

- venn():
  - Fix warning message that was missing spaces between words.

Other Changes:

- The smartlegend(), plot.lm2(), and boxplot.n() functions are now
  defunct. Please use grephics::legend(), lmplot2() or boxplot2()
  respectively.


Release 2.17.0 - 2015-05-01
---------------------------

New Features:

- heatmap.2() has two new arguments, 'colRow' and 'colCol' to control
  the color of row and column text labels. See the man page for
  examples.

- heatmap.2() has been modified to make it easier to extract and plot
  subclusters from a large heatmap. Simply pass the dendrogram of the
  subcluster together with the full data matrix and, optionally, the
  breaks of the full heatmap in order to obtain the same color
  scaling. (Suggestion and patch contributed by Ilia Kats.)

- venn() now returns a list of the members of each set intersection in
  the attribute 'intersections'.  This can be disabled using the
  argument 'intersection=FALSE' (Patch by Steffen Mller.)

Bug Fixes:

- In heatmap.2(), the color key now properly handles color breaks that
  are not equally spaced. (Issue reported by Tim Richter-Heitmann.)

- In heatmap.2(), row/column traces in could be plotted on the wrong
  row/column.

- plotCI() now properly respects the 'type=' argument.  (Bug report
  and correction by Wiktor elazny.)

- Remove stray browser() call from overplot()

- In the balloonplot() examples, explicitly specify the 'neworder'
  argument to gplots:::reorder.factor to prevent errors.

Other Changes:

- smartlegend() is now deprecated because the relative positioning
  feature ('top', 'right') has been added to graphics::legend().
  Calling smartlegend() will generate a warning.

- boxplot.n() and plot.lm2() are defunct have been removed.  Use of
  these functions will now generate an error.

- Update out-of-date URLs in man pages.

Release 2.16.0 - 2015-01-02
---------------------------

New Features:

- plotmeans() has a new argument, 'text.n.label' which specifies the
  text used for labeling the number of elements in a group.

Bug Fixes:

- plotmeans() now respects (optional) graphical arguments captured in
  '...' when drawing the x axis.


Release 2.15.0 - 2014-12-01
---------------------------

New features:

- Convert bandplot() to S3-method dispatch and add method for class
  formula, so that 'bandplot( y ~ x, data=dataframe )' now works as
  expected.

Other changes:

- heatmap.2() now uses a local *non-byte-compiled* copy of
  plot.dengrogram, because the byte-compiled stats:::plot.dendrogram
  uses a recursive algorithm that generates a 'node stack overflow'
  error for deeply nested dendrograms and the node stack size cannot
  be changed at execution time.  Instead, tne local non-byte-compiled
  gplots:::plot.dendrogram will trigger a recursion limit for such
  dengrograms.  heatmap.2() will detect this error and recommend that
  the user increase the recursion limit (via,
  e.g. 'options("expressions"=20000)' ) and rerun.

Release 2.14.2 - 2014-09-17
---------------------------

Bug Fixes:

- heatmap.2() was not respecting key.title=NA when density.info="none".

- Correct the man page for heatmap.2 to state that the default color
  for 'notecol' is cyan.

- In heatmap.2(), modify default arguments to 'symbreaks' and 'symkey'
  to make the logic more evident by replacing min(...) with
  any(...). (The previous code executed properly, but relied on
  implicit coercion of logicals to numeric, obscuring the intent.)

- Calling heatmap.2 with deeply nested dendrograms could trigger a
  'node stack overflow' error.  Now, this situation is deteceted, and
  a message is generated indicating how to increase the relevant
  recursion limit via options("expressions"=...).

Release 2.14.1 - 2014-06-30
---------------------------

Bug Fixes:

- Correct heatmap.2() bug in Colv dendrogram object dimension checking introduced
  in 2.14.0.  (Reported by Yong Fuga Li.)


Release 2.14.0 - 2014-06-18
---------------------------

Bug Fixes:

- heatmap.2(): Fix typo in heatmap.2() that caused an error when
  'Rowv=FALSE'. (Reported by Yuanhua Liu.)

Enhancements:

- heatmap.2(): Add new 'reorderfun' argument to allow the user to
  specify an alternative function to reorder rows/columns based on
  row/column dendrogram. (Suggested by Yuanhua Liu.)

- heatmap.2(): Center margin labels.

- heatmap.2(): Check size of user-provided Rowv and Colv dendrogram
  objects to ensure they match the dimensions of the data.

- Add references to man page for hist2d() and ci2d() to the new r2d2
  package which implements an improved algorithm for 2-dimensional
  emprical confidence regions.


Release 2.13.0 - 2014-04-04
---------------------------

Bug Fixes:

- heatmap.2 was not properly handling row trace reference line ('hline').
  Patch submitted by Ilia Kats.

Enhancements:

- In heatmap.2, when the row or column trace is enabled, show the
  corresponding reference line in the color key.

- In heatmap.2, a new 'extrafun' argument is provided that allows the
  user to specify a function to be called before the function returns.
  This allows the user to add additional plots to the page.


Release 2.12.1 - 2013-10-14
---------------------------

API Changes:

- boxplot.n() has been renamed to boxplot2() to avoid potential S3
  method calling issues.

- plot.lm2() has been rename to lmplot2() to avoid potential S3 method
  calling issues.

Enhancements:

- Add heatmap.2() parameters to control row and column label rotation
  ('srtRow', 'srtCol'), justification ('adjRow', 'adjCol'), and space
  from plot edge ('offsetRow', 'offsetCol').

Bug Fixes:

- Fix error in in venn() when all groups contained the same number of TRUE cases.

- Correct error in overplot() when that occured when a group-category contained no
  finite values.

Other Changes:

- Changes to overplot() to avoid warnings from upcoming enhancements to R CMD check.

- Move several packages from Depends to Imports or Suggests.

- Packages caTools and KernSmooth now have namespaces, so import
  needed functions in NAMESPACE.

- Mark one example in manual page for ci2d 'dontrun' to avoid timing
  warning in R CMD check.


Release 2.11.3 - 2013-06-27
---------------------------

Enhancements:

- Modify sinkplot() to use a local environment rather than the global
  environment, to conform to CRAN policies.

Bug Fixes:

- Fixed typo/spelling error in plotmeans() man page.


Release 2.11.2 - 2013-03-24
---------------------------

Enhancements:

- Add ci.width argument to barplot2() to allow varying the length of
  the 't' at the end of confidence interval bars.

Bug Fixes:

- Fix error in heatmap.2 when colsep argument had length 1.

Updates:

- Update manual page for lowess.default() to
  match changed argument list for lowess() in R 3.0.0


Release 2.11.1 - 2012-12-14
---------------------------

Bug Fixes:

- Replace corrupted BalloonPlot.pdf in inst/doc.


Release 2.11.0 - 2012-06-08
---------------------------

New Features:

- Objects returned by hist2d() have been changed:
  1) $x and $y now contain the n midpoints of the bins in each direction
  2) $x.breaks, $y.breaks now contain the n+1 limits of the bins in
  each direction.

- Add lwd argument to plotmeans().

Bug Fixes:

- Correct error in handling binning in hist2d(): (N+1)x(N+1) bins were
   being created instead of NxN bins, and the highest row/column in
   each direction was being omitted from the results and plot.

- Changes to fix R CMD check warnings


Release 2.10.1 - 2011-09-02
---------------------------

New features:

- Make results of hist2d() and ci2d() into objects, and add print()
  methods to display them.

Release 2.10.0 - 2011-08-26
---------------------------

New Features:

- New ci2d() function to create 2-dimensional empirical confidence
  intervals utilizing KernSmooth:bkde2D and gplots::hist2d().
  See ?ci2d for details.

- Add 'alpha' argument to rich.colors() to control transparency.

Improvements:

- Accellerate hist2d by replacing for() loop with tapply(), and allow
  user to specify summary function applied (per suggestion by Peter
  Hagedorn).

Bug Fixes:

- Correct error in heatmap.2() that arises when data includes NA values
  (identified by Melissa Key).


Release 2.8.0 - 2010-06-10
--------------------------

Improvements:

- venn() now returns an object of class venn() and a plot method for
  this class is provided.

- Manual page for venn has been improved, based on contributions by
  Steffen Moeller


Release 2.7.5 - ??
--------------------------

Improvements:

- Performance of 'hist2d' improved thanks to a suggestion from
  Joerg van den Hoff.

Release 2.7.4 - 2009-11-12
--------------------------

Bug Fixes:

- Correct bug reported by Alan Yong:  plotmeans() failed when bars=FALSE.

Release 2.7.3 - 2009-10-22
--------------------------

Bug Fixes:

- Correct bug reported by Rudolf Talens: heatmap.2() incorrectly
  transposed the displayed matrix when the option symm=TRUE.


Release 2.7.2 - 2009-05-08
--------------------------

Bug Fixes:

- Correct bug reported by Ken Lo:  cox2hex() had blue and green
  components swapped.


Release 2.7.1 - 2009-05-08
--------------------------

New Features:


- Enhancements to heatmap.2()

    - New arguments 'lmat', 'lhei', and 'lwid' that allow controlling
      component plot layout.  Users can now resize and rearrange plot
      components.

    - heatmap.2() will now compute color breakpoints that are
      symmetric about 0 when the new 'symbreak' parameter is TRUE.  This
      parameter, as well as the symkey parameter now default to TRUE
      whenever negative values of x are present, and to FALSE othewise.

    - the heatmap.2() return value now includes additional useful
      information, including: call, rowMeans, rowSDs, colMeans,
      colSDs, carpet (reordered and scaled 'x' values), rowDendrogram,
      colDendrogram, breaks, col, vline, hline, and colorTable. Of
      these, the most useful are breaks, col, and colorTable.  The
      latter is a three-column data frame providing the lower and
      upper bound and color for each bin.

  See the manual page for complete details and examples.


- New function venn(), contributed by Steffen Moeller (Thanks
  Steffen!) to generate Venn diagrams for up to 5 sets. See ?venn for
  details.

- Performance of bandplot() has been dramatically improved, in part by
  using runsd() and runmean() from the caTools package.  As a
  consequence, gplots now depends on the caTools package.

- Improved performance of gplots::plot.lm for large lm objects by
  using the new bandplot() and by using fitted() instead of predict()
  to obtain y-hat.

- Add 'scale.range' argument to balloonplot(), option to scale
  balloons so [min,max]->[0,1] ('relative') or [0,max] -> [0,1]
  ('absolute').


Bug Fixes:

- balloonplot() now properly handles dimension labels provided by
  'xlab' and 'ylab'

Release 2.0.8
-------------

 - Added DESCRIPTION and removed DESCRIPTION.in

 - Updated barplot2

 - Updated heatmap.2

Release 3.1.3 - 2022-04-24
--------------------------
Bug Fixes:
- Fix warning:

checking Rd files ... [1s/2s] WARNING
checkRd: (7) barplot2.Rd:219: invalid email address: marc\_schwartz@comcast.net
checkRd: (7) venn.Rd:59: invalid email address: steffen\_moeller@gmx.de

- Fix note:

checking Rd cross-references ... NOTE
Undeclared package r2d2 in Rd xrefs

- Fix note:

Found if() conditions comparing class() to string:
File 'gplots/R/heatmap.2.R': if (class(col) == "function") ...
Use inherits() (or maybe is()) instead.

Release 3.1.2 - 2021-01-09
--------------------------
Bug Fixes:
- heatmap.2: Also use key.title in cases without density #4




Release 3.1.1 - 2020-11-28
--------------------------
Bug Fixes:
- Fix "Error in plot.window(...) : need finite 'ylim' values" in "Running examples in 'gplots-Ex.R' failed"




Release 3.1.0 - 2020-09-18
--------------------------
Major change:
- Removed gdata from imports by bringing into the package the functions nobs and reorder.factor.
  - Removed the gdata package from "imports" since it is currently broken and is scheduled to archive in 2020-09-25 (leading to gplots to be archived as well, unless this is resolved). By removing this connection, gplots will be able to remain safely on CRAN. In prectice, I've moved reorder.factor and nobs into this package, as well as removed the use of 'nobs' from some examples.
  - Added the reorder.factor and nobs function (from gdata)


Release 3.0.4 - 2020-07-05
--------------------------
Bug Fixes:
- Fix "no visible global function definition for '%||%'": The package imports .memberDend and .midDend from stats in an unsafe way (i.e. using :::). I've moved to manually copy-pasting the functions into the package in order to keep it a bit safer. It has the downside of not using whartever improvements/bugfixes are intrudced to these functions moving forward. But for the time being, it's a reasonable solution.

Release 3.0.3 - 2020-02-26
--------------------------

Misc
- Tal Galili took over to make sure the package stays on CRAN.
- Moved to knitr

Release 3.0.1 - 2016-03-30
--------------------------

Bug Fixes:

- An error in plotLowess() prevented it from finding objects in
	the caller's environment.

- The manual page for heatmap.2() stated the incorrect type for
  the 'layout' element of the return list.  It is a named list,
  not a named numeric vector.


Release 3.0.0 - 2016-03-28
---------------------------

New Features:

- venn():
    - now support matrices of indicator values. Previously indicator
      values were only supported when supplied as a dataframe.
    - The 'intersections' attribute returned from venn() has been
      improved so that goups are labeled using set names instead
      of indicators, and are ordered from simplest to most complex
      set intersection.

- New angleAxis() function to create axis labels with rotated text.

- heatmap.2():
    - heatmap.2() can now be used to plot subsets of a previous
      heatmap.
    - Decrease the granularity of the carpet in heatmap.2()'s
      color key to avoid visual artifacts.
    - Returned object now includes 'layout' element that contains
      layout information. (Patch provided by Jenny Drnevich.)

- lowess():
    - New function plotLowess() to display a scatter plot with a
      superimposed lowess curve.
    - The lowess() functions now returns a list object of class
      'lowess'
    - A new lowess method for plot() method for 'lowess' objects
      that generates a scatterplot of the raw data with a lowess
      curve superimposed.

Bug Fixes:

- Defunct message for boxplot.n() was recommending the wrong
  function.

- heatmap.2():
  - Remove debugging print() statement.
  - Now properly sets 'srtCol' default if missing and 'colCol' is
    specified.
  - Corrected a bug causing "Error in plot.new() : figure margins
    too large" to occur when 'key=FALSE'.  (Reported and patch
    provided by Sveinung Gundersen.)
  - Corrected a bug causing an error when "Rowv=FALSE" or "Colv=FALSE".
  - Corrected message when "Rowv=FALSE" or "Colv=FALSE" and the the
    "dendrogram" argument requested the corresponding dendrogram.

- venn():
  - Fix warning message that was missing spaces between words.

Other Changes:

- The smartlegend(), plot.lm2(), and boxplot.n() functions are now
  defunct. Please use grephics::legend(), lmplot2() or boxplot2()
  respectively.


Release 2.17.0 - 2015-05-01
---------------------------

New Features:

- heatmap.2() has two new arguments, 'colRow' and 'colCol' to control
  the color of row and column text labels. See the man page for
  examples.

- heatmap.2() has been modified to make it easier to extract and plot
  subclusters from a large heatmap. Simply pass the dendrogram of the
  subcluster together with the full data matrix and, optionally, the
  breaks of the full heatmap in order to obtain the same color
  scaling. (Suggestion and patch contributed by Ilia Kats.)

- venn() now returns a list of the members of each set intersection in
  the attribute 'intersections'.  This can be disabled using the
  argument 'intersection=FALSE' (Patch by Steffen Mller.)

Bug Fixes:

- In heatmap.2(), the color key now properly handles color breaks that
  are not equally spaced. (Issue reported by Tim Richter-Heitmann.)

- In heatmap.2(), row/column traces in could be plotted on the wrong
  row/column.

- plotCI() now properly respects the 'type=' argument.  (Bug report
  and correction by Wiktor elazny.)

- Remove stray browser() call from overplot()

- In the balloonplot() examples, explicitly specify the 'neworder'
  argument to gplots:::reorder.factor to prevent errors.

Other Changes:

- smartlegend() is now deprecated because the relative positioning
  feature ('top', 'right') has been added to graphics::legend().
  Calling smartlegend() will generate a warning.

- boxplot.n() and plot.lm2() are defunct have been removed.  Use of
  these functions will now generate an error.

- Update out-of-date URLs in man pages.

Release 2.16.0 - 2015-01-02
---------------------------

New Features:

- plotmeans() has a new argument, 'text.n.label' which specifies the
  text used for labeling the number of elements in a group.

Bug Fixes:

- plotmeans() now respects (optional) graphical arguments captured in
  '...' when drawing the x axis.


Release 2.15.0 - 2014-12-01
---------------------------

New features:

- Convert bandplot() to S3-method dispatch and add method for class
  formula, so that 'bandplot( y ~ x, data=dataframe )' now works as
  expected.

Other changes:

- heatmap.2() now uses a local *non-byte-compiled* copy of
  plot.dengrogram, because the byte-compiled stats:::plot.dendrogram
  uses a recursive algorithm that generates a 'node stack overflow'
  error for deeply nested dendrograms and the node stack size cannot
  be changed at execution time.  Instead, tne local non-byte-compiled
  gplots:::plot.dendrogram will trigger a recursion limit for such
  dengrograms.  heatmap.2() will detect this error and recommend that
  the user increase the recursion limit (via,
  e.g. 'options("expressions"=20000)' ) and rerun.

Release 2.14.2 - 2014-09-17
---------------------------

Bug Fixes:

- heatmap.2() was not respecting key.title=NA when density.info="none".

- Correct the man page for heatmap.2 to state that the default color
  for 'notecol' is cyan.

- In heatmap.2(), modify default arguments to 'symbreaks' and 'symkey'
  to make the logic more evident by replacing min(...) with
  any(...). (The previous code executed properly, but relied on
  implicit coercion of logicals to numeric, obscuring the intent.)

- Calling heatmap.2 with deeply nested dendrograms could trigger a
  'node stack overflow' error.  Now, this situation is deteceted, and
  a message is generated indicating how to increase the relevant
  recursion limit via options("expressions"=...).

Release 2.14.1 - 2014-06-30
---------------------------

Bug Fixes:

- Correct heatmap.2() bug in Colv dendrogram object dimension checking introduced
  in 2.14.0.  (Reported by Yong Fuga Li.)


Release 2.14.0 - 2014-06-18
---------------------------

Bug Fixes:

- heatmap.2(): Fix typo in heatmap.2() that caused an error when
  'Rowv=FALSE'. (Reported by Yuanhua Liu.)

Enhancements:

- heatmap.2(): Add new 'reorderfun' argument to allow the user to
  specify an alternative function to reorder rows/columns based on
  row/column dendrogram. (Suggested by Yuanhua Liu.)

- heatmap.2(): Center margin labels.

- heatmap.2(): Check size of user-provided Rowv and Colv dendrogram
  objects to ensure they match the dimensions of the data.

- Add references to man page for hist2d() and ci2d() to the new r2d2
  package which implements an improved algorithm for 2-dimensional
  emprical confidence regions.


Release 2.13.0 - 2014-04-04
---------------------------

Bug Fixes:

- heatmap.2 was not properly handling row trace reference line ('hline').
  Patch submitted by Ilia Kats.

Enhancements:

- In heatmap.2, when the row or column trace is enabled, show the
  corresponding reference line in the color key.

- In heatmap.2, a new 'extrafun' argument is provided that allows the
  user to specify a function to be called before the function returns.
  This allows the user to add additional plots to the page.


Release 2.12.1 - 2013-10-14
---------------------------

API Changes:

- boxplot.n() has been renamed to boxplot2() to avoid potential S3
  method calling issues.

- plot.lm2() has been rename to lmplot2() to avoid potential S3 method
  calling issues.

Enhancements:

- Add heatmap.2() parameters to control row and column label rotation
  ('srtRow', 'srtCol'), justification ('adjRow', 'adjCol'), and space
  from plot edge ('offsetRow', 'offsetCol').

Bug Fixes:

- Fix error in in venn() when all groups contained the same number of TRUE cases.

- Correct error in overplot() when that occured when a group-category contained no
  finite values.

Other Changes:

- Changes to overplot() to avoid warnings from upcoming enhancements to R CMD check.

- Move several packages from Depends to Imports or Suggests.

- Packages caTools and KernSmooth now have namespaces, so import
  needed functions in NAMESPACE.

- Mark one example in manual page for ci2d 'dontrun' to avoid timing
  warning in R CMD check.


Release 2.11.3 - 2013-06-27
---------------------------

Enhancements:

- Modify sinkplot() to use a local environment rather than the global
  environment, to conform to CRAN policies.

Bug Fixes:

- Fixed typo/spelling error in plotmeans() man page.


Release 2.11.2 - 2013-03-24
---------------------------

Enhancements:

- Add ci.width argument to barplot2() to allow varying the length of
  the 't' at the end of confidence interval bars.

Bug Fixes:

- Fix error in heatmap.2 when colsep argument had length 1.

Updates:

- Update manual page for lowess.default() to
  match changed argument list for lowess() in R 3.0.0


Release 2.11.1 - 2012-12-14
---------------------------

Bug Fixes:

- Replace corrupted BalloonPlot.pdf in inst/doc.


Release 2.11.0 - 2012-06-08
---------------------------

New Features:

- Objects returned by hist2d() have been changed:
  1) $x and $y now contain the n midpoints of the bins in each direction
  2) $x.breaks, $y.breaks now contain the n+1 limits of the bins in
  each direction.

- Add lwd argument to plotmeans().

Bug Fixes:

- Correct error in handling binning in hist2d(): (N+1)x(N+1) bins were
   being created instead of NxN bins, and the highest row/column in
   each direction was being omitted from the results and plot.

- Changes to fix R CMD check warnings


Release 2.10.1 - 2011-09-02
---------------------------

New features:

- Make results of hist2d() and ci2d() into objects, and add print()
  methods to display them.

Release 2.10.0 - 2011-08-26
---------------------------

New Features:

- New ci2d() function to create 2-dimensional empirical confidence
  intervals utilizing KernSmooth:bkde2D and gplots::hist2d().
  See ?ci2d for details.

- Add 'alpha' argument to rich.colors() to control transparency.

Improvements:

- Accellerate hist2d by replacing for() loop with tapply(), and allow
  user to specify summary function applied (per suggestion by Peter
  Hagedorn).

Bug Fixes:

- Correct error in heatmap.2() that arises when data includes NA values
  (identified by Melissa Key).


Release 2.8.0 - 2010-06-10
--------------------------

Improvements:

- venn() now returns an object of class venn() and a plot method for
  this class is provided.

- Manual page for venn has been improved, based on contributions by
  Steffen Moeller


Release 2.7.5 - ??
--------------------------

Improvements:

- Performance of 'hist2d' improved thanks to a suggestion from
  Joerg van den Hoff.

Release 2.7.4 - 2009-11-12

  transposed the displayed matrix when the option symm=TRUE.


Release 2.7.2 - 2009-05-08
--------------------------

Bug Fixes:

- Correct bug reported by Ken Lo:  cox2hex() had blue and green
  components swapped.

--------------------------

New Features:


- Enhancements to heatmap.2()

    - New arguments 'lmat', 'lhei', and 'lwid' that allow controlling
      component plot layout.  Users can now resize and rearrange plot
      components.

    - heatmap.2() will now compute color breakpoints that are
      symmetric about 0 when the new 'symbreak' parameter is TRUE.  This
      parameter, as well as the symkey parameter now default to TRUE
      whenever negative values of x are present, and to FALSE othewise.

    - the heatmap.2() return value now includes additional useful
      information, including: call, rowMeans, rowSDs, colMeans,
      colSDs, carpet (reordered and scaled 'x' values), rowDendrogram,
      colDendrogram, breaks, col, vline, hline, and colorTable. Of
      these, the most useful are breaks, col, and colorTable.  The
      latter is a three-column data frame providing the lower and
      upper bound and color for each bin.

  See the manual page for complete details and examples.


- New function venn(), contributed by Steffen Moeller (Thanks
  Steffen!) to generate Venn diagrams for up to 5 sets. See ?venn for
  details.

- Performance of bandplot() has been dramatically improved, in part by

- Add 'scale.range' argument to balloonplot(), option to scale
  balloons so [min,max]->[0,1] ('relative') or [0,max] -> [0,1]
  ('absolute').


Bug Fixes:

- balloonplot() now properly handles dimension labels provided by
  'xlab' and 'ylab'

- plotCI now properly handles 'NULL' and 'NA' values for ui, li, uiw,
  and liw.

allow for a quick overview on the number of elements that multiple
sets share. And when those elements are representing traits of
real objects, like observations in biomedical sciences/marketing/...,
then this may direct researchers to further investigations/decisions.

The {\tt gplots} package provides Venn diagrams for up to five sets.
The R code to produce the diagrams is not complicated. The plot
function behaves alwas the same, depending only on the number of
overlapping circles to draw. Its input is a table that is produced
by another function. The function {\tt venn()} calls one after the
other and is the only one to be seen by the user. The values shown
are returned invisibly.

The {\tt venn()} function accepts either a list of sets as an argument,
or it takes a binary matrix, one column per set, indicating for every
element, one per row, the membership with every set.

The common form with overlapping circles only works with up to three
sets, as seen here:
\begin{center}
<<fig=TRUE,echo=TRUE>>=
suppressMessages(library(gplots))
venn( list(A=1:5,B=4:6,C=c(4,8:10)) )
@
\end{center}

The names of columns or the list elements are the set names.
To squeeze extra circles in, those circles need to become ellipses.
This works for four sets
\begin{center}
<<fig=TRUE,echo=TRUE>>=
v.table<-venn( list(A=1:5,B=4:6,C=c(4,8:10),D=c(4:12)) )
print(v.table)
@
\end{center}

and maybe even more impressively also for five.
\begin{center}
<<fig=TRUE,echo=FALSE>>=
venn( list(A=1:5,B=4:6,C=c(4,8:10),D=c(4:12),E=c(2,4,6:9)) )
@
\end{center}

The man page of {\it venn()} lists options to change the appearance of
the plots, e.g., the names of the sets may be omitted and sizes changed.
However, there is ample of opportunity to extend the functionality of
this package.  To mind come

\begin{itemize}
\item more dimensions (next)
\item colors
\item variation of size of circles with the number of members the set has
\item density plot rather than numbers, identification of individual entries
\end{itemize}

The prime personal interest is more in the increase of dimensions. Please
send patches for features you are most interested in.
